You can manage your notifications using the **My Notification** view on the **Notifications** settings page. You access the **Notifications** settings page through the **Notification settings**![Notification settings icon](https://docs-dev.uipath.com/api/binary/test-cloud/2/636657/362809) icon on the **Notifications** panel or the **Preferences** menu option from your user account menu.

The following section describes how to view and manage your notifications in the **Notifications** panel and the **Notifications** settings, and the notification events you can subscribe to.

## Viewing and accessing notifications

You can access notifications through the **Notifications** panel only.

To access the **Notifications** panel, go to the top navigation bar and select the bell ![Bell icon](https://documentationpicturerepo.blob.core.windows.net/screenshots/screenshots/00_Action_Center_Automation_Cloud/bell_icon_notifications_panel.png) icon. The **Notifications** panel displays notifications ordered by date, in descending order. The **Notifications** panel displays notifications from newest to oldest.

To access a specific notification, select the desired notification frame.

### Filtering notifications

While you're in the **Notifications** panel, you can further filter the notifications, so you can view certain notifications first. To filter the notifications that you receive in the **Notifications** panel:

1. Open the **Notifications** panel.
2. Select the **Service** dropdown and then select the service for which you want to view notifications.
3. Select the **Severity** dropdown and then select the severity of the notifications that you want to view.

## Viewing and accessing email notifications

When an event that you are subscribed to takes place, an email notification is generated and sent to the email address that you used to create your account. To access the email notifications, check out the inbox of the email address where you know the notifications will be sent.

You can get the following information from the email:

* Read general information about the event that took place.
* Navigate to the corresponding service and tenant where the event took place.

To receive email notifications, your Organization administrator need to enable the **Enable email notifications** option from the **Preferences** menu, on the **Email configuratio**n tab.

With **Actionable notifications** you can quickly complete simple tasks directly from your inbox, without having to log in to Action Center:

* Approve an action
* Reject an action
* Add comments to an action

You can also select **View full task in Action Center** to access all the task details in Action Center.

To have Actionable notifications, you need to enable this option when you [Create App Task](https://docs.uipath.html/).
