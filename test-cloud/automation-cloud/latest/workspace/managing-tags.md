Tags help you organize and easily identify product resources. They allow you to attach a recognizable flag to certain objects, thus grouping together resources that pertain to a certain process.

Tags are stored by Orchestrator and the [Resource Catalog Service](https://docs.uipath.com/orchestrator/automation-cloud/latest/admin-guide/about-resource-catalog-service), and consist of labels and/or key-value pairs applied to your objects. For example, you can apply the label `SAP` and the key-value pair `Department: Finance` to all the objects involved in SAP automation in the Finance department of your company.
:::note
Tag operations performed at the platform administration level, such as creating, editing, or deleting a tag, are not currently audited.

## Creating tags

There are two types of tags that you can create: labels and properties (key-value pairs).

1. Go to **Admin** and select the desired tenant from the left pane.
2. Select **Tags**. The **Labels** and **Properties (key-value pairs)** options are displayed.

### Labels

The **Labels** page displays a list of all labels created for that tenant, along with a description and the number of objects it is attached to.From this page, you can also create a new label, by selecting **Add label** and setting a name and a description.

### Properties (Key-value pairs)

The **Properties (Key-value pairs)** page displays a list of all keys and values created for that tenant, along with a description and the number of objects each pair is attached to.

From this page, you can also create a new property, by selecting **Add property** and configuring these options:

* **Key name**
* **Description**
* **Value data type** - this can no longer be changed once the property is created. The available options are:
  + **String**This can include digits and symbols. The <, >, %, &, , /, ?, : characters are not allowed.
  + **Number**Only digits (0 - 9) and the minus character (-) are allowed for integer values.
  + **Boolean (True/False)**This data type cannot be modified.
  + **Custom (Regex)**The **Regex rule** field is displayed, allowing you to add the desired string. The rule you add in this field is also displayed in the **Add new value(s)** window, as a read-only reference.
* **Values** - use **Add values** to insert new values in the list.

### Creating tags in Orchestrator

Tags can also be [created from Orchestrator](https://docs.uipath.com/orchestrator/automation-cloud/latest/admin-guide/organizing-resources-with-tags), at the object level. However, properties (key-value pairs) can only be generated as strings in this context.All tags created in Orchestrator are included in the appropriate lists in the Admin **Tags** menu.

## Viewing tagged objects
:::note
This option is only available for labels.
:::

To view the objects that a label is attached to, you can select **List tagged objects** in its contextual menu. The menu item is suffixed by the total number of objects tagged with this label, and selecting it directs you to the list of Orchestrator items in the Orchestrator tenant search window.

**Notes**:
* Tagged packages are counted towards the total number of tagged objects displayed in the **Tags** page, but they are not displayed in the Orchestrator tenant search window. To view tagged packages, you need to access the Orchestrator **Packages** page and filter the list manually.
* Tagged Action Center objects are not included in this list.

## Editing tags

When you edit a tag, the changes are propagated to all objects associated to it.

### Labels

You can edit the names and descriptions of labels by selecting **Edit** in the contextual menu of the desired label.If the new name you select for your label is the same as that of an existing label, an error message is displayed under the field.

### Properties (Key-value pairs)

You can edit the following by selecting the appropriate option in the contextual menu of the desired property:

* Key details - the name and description of the property. If you edit the name of a property, and the new name is the same as that of an existing property, an error message is displayed under the field.
* Values - you can delete existing property values or add new ones.

## Deleting tags

Both labels and properties can be deleted from their respective contextual menu.

If they are already in use, a warning message is displayed, informing you of how many objects will be affected if the tag is removed. You can choose to cancel or proceed with the deletion.

You can also delete individual values of a property without removing the property in its entirety. This is done from the value editing window. If the value you are trying to delete is already in use, you are warned that its associated objects will be affected, and you can choose to cancel or proceed with the deletion.

## Roles and permissions

To use this feature, you need to be an organization administrator. All other roles have the **Tags** menu greyed out.The individual actions that you can perform on tags are further controlled by the **View**, **Edit**, **Create**, and **Delete** permissions for **Tags**.
