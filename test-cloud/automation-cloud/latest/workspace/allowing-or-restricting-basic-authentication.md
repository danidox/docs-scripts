**Basic authentication** refers to signing in with the username and password of a local account.

If basic authentication is restricted, your users can only log in with their directory account, as defined in the external identity provider. Otherwise, users can log in with both their local accounts, if any, and their directory accounts.

## Setting basic authentication at the organization level

To allow or restrict basic authentication for your organization:

1. Navigate to the **Admin** section, select **Security**.
2. Under **Sign-in options for local users**, turn on the **Basic sign-in** toggle to allow sign in using basic authentication:
3. Select **Save** to apply your changes.
