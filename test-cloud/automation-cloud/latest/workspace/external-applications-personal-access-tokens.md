A Personal Access Token (PAT) is a unique alphanumeric string that serves as a substitute for your credentials and grants you controlled access to specific UiPath resources while maintaining a high level of security.

As an admin, you have access to all the PATs generated within your organization. You can view key details such as the PAT owner, access scopes, the last usage date, and expiration date of the PAT.
:::note
PATs are currently limited to users with local accounts only.

## Enabling/disabling PAT support

To enable/disable PATs for all users in the organization, follow these steps:

1. In the **Admin** section for the organization, go to **External Apps**, and then select the **Personal Access Token** tab to display the PAT configuration window.
2. Select **Settings** and on the **Settings** window, turn on or off the **Enable/Disable PAT for all users** option to enable or disable the PAT functionality.
3. On the **Maximum Lifespan** field, enter the validity duration of a PAT in the organization. This duration represents the timeframe after which the PAT expires.
4. Select **Save** to save your changes or **Cancel** to return to the previous window without saving your changes.

## Revoking PATs

As an admin, you have access to all the PATs generated within your organization. You can view key details such as the PAT owner, access scopes, the last usage date, and expiration date of the PAT. Based on this information, you can select specific PATs and revoke them as follows:

1. Go to **Admin** and select the organization at the top of the panel on the left.
2. Select **External applications**.
3. Select the **Personal Access Token** tab. The **Personal Access Token** page is displayed, showing a list of personal tokens generated in the organization and their specific details (owner, name, last usage time, access scopes, expiration date).

4. Based on the PAT details, select **Revoke** for the PAT you want to revoke. To revoke multiple PATs, check the boxes of the PATs you want to disable and select **Revoke**. A confirmation window is displayed.
5. Select **Revoke** in the confirmation window to confirm the operation. A success message is displayed and the PAT is removed from the tokens list.

## Revoking a known PAT

As an admin, if you discover a leak and are aware of the specific leaked token, you can promptly revoke the PAT yourself.

1. Go to **Admin** and select the organization.
2. Select **External applications**.
3. Select the **Personal Access Token** tab. The **Personal Access Token** page is displayed, showing a list of personal tokens generated in the organization and their specific details.
4. Select the **Revoke** button. The **Revoke token** window is displayed.

5. Enter the specific token to be revoked in the **Revoke token** window, and select **Revoke** to confirm. If the exact token is successfully found in the PATs list, a success message is displayed, and the token is revoked and removed from the list. However, if the token can't be located, the revoking attempt fails with an error message.
