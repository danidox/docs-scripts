Use this procedure to migrate Looker data from Insights Standalone to Insights Automation Suite.

## Step 1: Create Backup TAR File From Insights Linux Server

1. Open an SSH client and run the following command to authenticate.
   ```
   ssh <username>@<hostname>
   ```

2. Create a backup.
   ```
   image=$(sudo docker container inspect looker-container -f '{{ .Image }}')
   backupPath="$HOME/insights/backup" && mkdir "$backupPath" -p
   sudo docker run -u root --rm --platform linux --volumes-from looker-container -v "$backupPath":/backup "$image" bash -c "tar cvf /backup/looker_backup.tar --absolute-names /app/workdir/.db /mnt/lookerfiles /app/workdir/looker.key"
   ```
   :::note
   Starting with the 2022.10 version, the `looker.key` is included in the migration backup.

3. Exit the SSH.
   ```
   exit
   ```
4. Copy the files to the local machine using Secure Copy Protocol (SCP).
   ```
   scp <username>@<hostname>:~\insights\backup\looker_backup.tar <path-to-download-dir>
   ```

## Step 2: Restore Looker

1. Download the `kubeconfig` file. The following screenshot shows an [Azure deployment template for Automation Suite](https://docs.uipath.com/automation-suite/docs/azure-deployment-architecture).

2. Open an SSH client and run the following command to get the Insights Looker pod name
   ```
   $Env:KUBECONFIG="C:\Users\username\Downloads\output.yaml" # path to the optput.yaml
   kubectl get pods -n uipath
   ```
3. The Insights Looker pod is now listed (e.g., `insights-insightslooker-c987df55c-gngqd`).![docs image](https://docs.uipath.com/api/binary/automation-suite/2/309203/158839)
4. Set a variable name for the Insights Looker pod.
   ```
   $PodName = "insights-insightslooker-74db798bc5-dt68p"
   ```
5. Create a backup for the Automation Suite data. The backup file will be stored on a machine with console where command is initiated. Please make sure to delete created backup because it contains sensitive information.
   ```
   kubectl cp ${PodName}:/app/workdir/.db/ .\sf_db_backup -n uipath -c insightslooker
   kubectl cp ${PodName}:/mnt/lookerfiles/ .\sf_lookerfiles_backup -n uipath -c insightslooker
   ```
6. Unzip the TAR file from the Insights Linux Server.
   ```
   7z x .\looker_backup.tar -olooker_backup # looker_backup is the output folder
   ```
7. (Conditionally required if the Automation Suite password is different from the one used in the Standalone deployment model) Edit the following files before the migration and update url and/or password in both **looker.log** and **looker.script** files.

Open `sf_db_backup/looker.log` and search for `host_url` to find the string that starts with `https://`.
   ![docs image](https://docs.uipath.com/api/binary/automation-suite/2/309203/159588)

Search for `INSERT INTO "CREDENTIALS_EMAIL" VALUES(1,1,'admin@uipath.com'` in `sf_db_backup/looker.log`.
   ![docs image](https://docs.uipath.com/api/binary/automation-suite/2/309203/157461)

Copy the string that starts with `$2a$12$` and overwrite all occurrences in `looker_backup/app/.db/looker.log`.
   :::note
   * Turn off regex in the editor if you cannot find these lines.
   * If there are multiple occurrences of `INSERT INTO "CREDENTIALS_EMAIL" VALUES(1,1,'admin@uipath.com'` you need to update all of them.
   :::
8. Change the working directory to the `looker_backup` folder. In this folder you will see two sub-folders named `app` and `mnt`.
   ```
   cd looker_backup
   ```
9. Copy files to the insights Looker pod and then restart the deployment.
   ```
   kubectl cp .\app\workdir ${PodName}:/app -n uipath -c insightslooker
   kubectl cp .\mnt\lookerfiles ${PodName}:/mnt -n uipath -c insightslooker
   kubectl rollout restart statefulset insights-insightslooker -n uipath
   ```
