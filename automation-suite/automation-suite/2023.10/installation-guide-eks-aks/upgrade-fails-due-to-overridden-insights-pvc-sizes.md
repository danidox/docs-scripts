## Description

The upgrade can fail due to an issue where existing insights PVC sizes get overridden during the process. This issue occures due to unexpected changes to the PVC sizes that are not correctly reflected during the upgrade.

## Solution

To address the problem, you must manually change the PVC sizes in ArgoCD UI:

1. In the ArgoCU UI, select Insights.
2. From the upper-left corner, select the **Details** button and then select the **Parameters** tab.
3. From the upper-right corner, select the **Edit** button and update the `size` parameter under `insightslooker.insightslooker.persistence` according to your deployed PVC size.
   * To retrieve the correct size of `insights-looker-lookerdir-pvc`, run the following command:
     ```
     kubectl get pvc -n uipath insights-looker-lookerdir-pvc -o json |jq -r .status.capacity.storage
     ```
   * To retrieve the correct size of `insights-looker-datadir-pvc`, run the following command:
     ```
     kubectl get pvc -n uipath insights-looker-datadir-pvc -o json |jq -r .status.capacity.storage
     ```
4. After you update the **VALUES** field, select the **SAVE** button and sync Insights.
