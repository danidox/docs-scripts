You must manually create your organizations in Automation Suite. The organization name must comply with the following Regex format: `'^(?!.*$)[a-zA-Z][A-Za-z0-9]+$'`.

The organization name must start with an uppercase or lowercase letter and must contain at least one character after the initial letter. Then, the name can include any combination of alphanumeric characters or underscores. Note, however, that the organization name must not end with an underscore.

For example, valid organization names include `Username`, `user_name1`, or `User123`. Make sure to avoid invalid formats such as `_username` (does not start with a letter), `username_`(ends with an underscore), `user name` (contains a space), or `user@name` (contains an invalid character).

:::note
You do not have to manually create the tenant as the migration tool automatically performs this operation for you. The organization and tenant names do not have to be identical. While the organization name is customizable, the Automation Suite tenant name is the same as the standalone Orchestrator tenant name.
