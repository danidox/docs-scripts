UiPath's Robot JavaScript SDK, or Robot JS, enables you to incorporate UiPath automation capabilities within your JavaScript applications. It provides a set of JavaScript libraries that act as a bridge of communication between JavaScript-based applications and UiPath Robots.

This SDK extends the ability to create, monitor, and manage processes directly from JavaScript applications.

## Prerequisites

To use RobotJS, you need to:

* install Studio and Robot installed on your machine (versions 2019.10 or greater),
* install Robot JavaScript add-on on the machine that executes the process, and
* connect the Robot to your Orchestrator instance.

## RobotJS on Windows OS

To use RobotJS add-on on Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 8 and 8.1, you need:

* Robot JS version 1.2.5+
* Robot version 2021.4.4+

## RobotJS on macOS

To use RobotJS add-on on macOS ARMv8 and AMD64, you need:

* Robot JS version 1.2.7+
* Robot version 2021.4.4+

It functions similarly as on Windows OS, with some exceptions:

* It does not support the Safari browser,
* it does not offer a standalone version, and
* it only executes cross-platform automations.

## Getting the Robot JavaScript SDK

Studio versions 2020.4+ provide the Robot JavaScript SDK by default. Licensed under Apache 2.0, you can download and installat it using the following sources:

| Source | Command |
| --- | --- |
| **NPM:** The SDK is available as an NPM package with TypeScript bindings. To include it in your project, run the following command in the root of your project directory. | ``` npm install --save @uipath/robot ``` |
| **CDN**: To include the SDK, add it before the closing of the `</body>` tag. | ``` <script href="https://download.uipath.com/js/1.3.2/UiPathRobot.js"/> ``` |
| **Direct download**: To get the minimized version of the Robot Javascript SDK in a.js package. | ``` https://download.uipath.com/js/1.3.2/UiPathRobot.js ``` |

## Documentation

The [Developer Guide](https://forum.uipath.com/t/developer-guide/194701) combined with the [User Guide](https://robotjs.uipath.com/static/RobotJS-Public%20Preview%20User%20Guide.pdf) offer a complete SDK and JavaScript add-on overview for Robot, detailing usage, prerequisites, and initial robot-enabled application creation.

You can also develop the Robot JavaScript SDK functionality in `.NET`, by using the commands.

## Specifications

* The full documentation of provides detailed information on the models and methods used by the Robot Javascript SDK.
* [Sample References](https://robotjs.uipath.com/samples) offer pre-built samples for boilerplate and office applications that can be easily integrated in your custom application.

## Try It

We have developed a practical demo using the Robot JavaScript SDK. This demo securely connects to your existing Robot, retrieves the processes from UiPath Assistant, and displays them.
