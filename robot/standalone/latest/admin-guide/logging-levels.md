## Overview

The log level refers to how detailed the generated message should be. You can configure it via:

* the **Log Level** setting in **Assistant** &gt; **Preferences** &gt; **General** page. By default, it is set to **Information**.
* the **Logging Level** setting in **Orchestrator** &gt; **Manage Access** &gt; **Users** &gt; user or robot account &gt; **Robot Settings** page. By default, it is set to **Information**.
  :::note
  The log level you set in Orchestrator overrides the level configured in Assistant.

Starting with version 2025.10.1, the Robot supports two different log levels: one for the logs sent to Orchestrator and another one for local files. To set the log level to local, use the `UIPATH_FILE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable as described [here](https://docs.uipath.com/robot/standalone/latest/admin-guide/configuration-files).
:::
UiPath uses the following log levels, listed in ascending order of their priority.

* **Off** - No logs are stored at all. This level is typically used to turn off logging.
* **Verbose** - Reports an even finer level of granularity, logging every possible detail about the automation operations. This could include information about variable changes, function calls, or even external responses. Displays all logs with the **Trace** level. By default, the Verbose level includes the following log entries:
  + **Execution Started** - generated every time a process is started.
  + **Execution Ended** - generated every time a process is finalized.
  + **Transaction Started** - generated every time a transaction item is obtained by the Robot from Orchestrator.
  + **Transaction Ended** - generated every time the Robot sets the transaction status to either **Success** or **Failed**.
  + **Activity Information** - generated every time an activity is started, faulted, or finished inside a process.
* **Trace** - These logs contain the most detailed information, often used for debugging or tracking specific task execution paths within the system. Displays all logs with the **Trace**, **Information**, **Warning**, **Error**, and **Critical** levels.
* **Information** - Informational logs provide general insights about the automation execution, such as start and end of tasks. Displays all logs with the **Information**, **Warning**, **Error**, and **Critical** levels.
* **Warning** - These logs include minor issues or potential problems that do not immediately affect the current operation but might become significant in the future. Displays all logs with the **Warning**, **Error**, and **Critical** levels.
* **Error** - Logs generated at this level include details of errors that have occurred during execution, which prevent normal workflow operation but do not cause the entire system to halt. Displays all logs with the **Error** and **Critical** levels.
* **Critical** - Logs that indicate a critical problem or error are recorded. Issues serious enough to require immediate attention are usually logged at this level.

## Sensitive information in logs

Log levels of **Information**, **Warning**, **Error**, and **Critical** do not track input/output argument values. This ensures sensitive data is excluded from the Orchestrator logs, unless it is intentionally added from UiPath Studio.

In contrast, log levels of **Trace** and **Verbose** do track and record values of input/output arguments, including sensitive data, in Orchestrator logs.

To hide sensitive information at the **Verbose** levels, you can use the `excludeLoggedData` variable, and provide specific keywords. For example:

```
"excludedLoggedData": [
      "Private:*",
      "<em>password</em>"
    ],
```

While configuring activities, you can select the **Private** checkbox to achieve the same thing. Refer to [Protecting Sensitive Information](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/standalone/latest/user-guide/protecting-sensitive-information).
