Service Mode and User Mode robots use different `NuGet.config` files.

A robot installed in User Mode has two `NuGet.config` files: one in the installation folder, and one in the user profile folder (`%AppData%\NuGet\NuGet.config`).

A robot installed in Service Mode uses the `NuGet.config` file from the installation folder.

To add or remove activity feeds, update any `NuGet.config` file, as follows:

1. Open the `NuGet.config` file with a text editor, such as Notepad++.
2. To add a new activity feed, in the `<packageSources>` section, add a new `<add/>` element, and provide the name as `key`, and the feed address as `value`:
   ```
   <packageSources>
       <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
       <add key="Online Feed" value="https://mycustomfeed.com" />
       <add key="Local Feed" value="C:\local feed" />
   </packageSources>
   ```
   :::note
   * You can add both local and online feeds.
   * To ignore HTTPS feeds from `NuGet.config`, add the following line in `UiPath.config`, under `&lt;packageSettings&gt;`:
   assignment
   ```
   &lt;add key="skipHttpConfigurationSources" value="true" /&gt;
   ```
   :::
3. To remove an activity feed, delete the corresponding `<add/>` tag.
4. Save the `NuGet.config` file, then restart the Robot service or the device.
