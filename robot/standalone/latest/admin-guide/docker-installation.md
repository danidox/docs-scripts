Installing Robots on Linux requires a Docker environment, a network connection to Orchestrator, and the client credentials of the machine template.

## The Docker image tag

To install the docker image of a specific Robot LTS version, you would need to mention the tag. For version 2024.10, the tag is `latest24.10`. To install the latest patch available, do not mention a tag. The command to download the docker image is:

```
docker pull uipathprod.azurecr.io/robot/uiautomation-runtime:<tag>
```

## Linux automations - particularities

* To create automations for Linux, ensure you have Chrome extension version 2021.10.4 or later. This allows the robot to execute background and foreground automations.
* To design a UI automation for Linux, you can select the following input methods for activities:
  + ChromiumAPI: The default input mode that lets robots interact directly with Chrome elements.
  + SimulateClick/SimulateType: Simulates user actions like clicking or typing on a webpage.Additionally, you can use the following tools:
  + Web Recorder: Replicates a series of actions on a webpage that a robot can replay.
  + Table Extraction: A tool to facilitate data extraction from web tables.

## Parameters for the `docker run` command

The following list summarizes the parameters used by the `docker run` command. Use this command to start the Docker image.

* `LICENSE_AGREEMENT=accept` - Accepts the [UiPath license agreement](https://www.uipath.com/developers/all-editions/license-agreement).
* `ORCHESTRATOR_URL="https://cloud.uipath.com/organization/tentant/orchestrator_"` - Sets the URL of the Orchestrator instance where your robots should connect.
* `CLIENT_ID="$Client_ID"` and `CLIENT_SECRET="$Client_secret"` - Set the client ID and client secret of the machine template. If you use the machine key, do not use these parameters.
* `MACHINE_KEY="$KEY"` - Sets the key of the machine template. If you use client ID and secret, do not use this parameter.
* `VNC_ENABLED=true` - Optional. Enables the live streaming of the Robot execution on Linux through Virtual Networking Computing (VNC). Requires port `5000:5900` for accessing the VNC server.
  :::important
  After enabling the VNC server, use any VNC client to live stream the robot execution.

The following examples show how to run the `docker run` command:

* Using the client ID and client secret:
  ```
  docker run -e LICENSE_AGREEMENT=accept -e ORCHESTRATOR_URL="https://cloud.uipath.com/organization/tentant/orchestrator_"-e CLIENT_ID="$Client_ID" -e CLIENT_SECRET="$Client_secret" -tid registry.uipath.com/robot/uiautomation-runtime:<tag>
  ```
* Using the machine key:
  ```
  docker run -e LICENSE_AGREEMENT=accept -e ORCHESTRATOR_URL="https://cloud.uipath.com/organization/tentant/orchestrator_" -e MACHINE_KEY="$KEY" -tid registry.uipath.com/robot/uiautomation-runtime:<tag>
  ```
* With `VNC_ENABLED=true`:
  ```
  docker run -e LICENSE_AGREEMENT=accept -e
  ORCHESTRATOR_URL="{orchestrator url}" -e MACHINE_KEY="{machine_key}" -p 50000:5900 --env VNC_ENABLED=true registry.uipath.com/robot/uiautomation-runtime:<tag>
  ```

## Orchestrator connection failure

Firewall rules might block the connection to Orchestrator. To address this, specify a DNS server in the `docker run` command. For example:

```
docker run --dns="1.1.1.1" -e LICENSE_AGREEMENT=accept -e ORCHESTRATOR_URL="https://cloud.uipath.com/organization/tentant/orchestrator_" -e CLIENT_ID="$Client_ID" -e CLIENT_SECRET="$Client_secret" -tid registry.uipath.com/robot/uiautomation-runtime:<tag>
```

The value `--dns="1.1.1.1"` represents the public DNS resolver from Cloudflare. You can use any DNS resolver to redirect the SignalR Hub.

## Configuring package feeds

Automations on Linux require certain libraries, which are stored in the `/home/robotuser/.nuget/Packages/` directory of a docker container. To configure this, you need to mount the directory containing the NuGet libraries. Add the following flag to the docker run command: `-v <path to packages on the host machine>:/home/robotuser/.nuget/Packages/`.

For example, using machine key:

```
docker run -e LICENSE_AGREEMENT=accept -e MACHINE_KEY="{machine_key}" -e ORCHESTRATOR_URL="https://cloud.uipath.com/organization/tentant/orchestrator_" -v <path to packages on the host machine>:/home/robotuser/.nuget/Packages -ti registry.uipath.com/robot/uiautomation-runtime
```

:::important
Make sure that the robot Linux user (UID1000) has read access to the mounted path leading to the package feeds.

## Remote debugging

To debug a running robot container, use the [Remote Debugging feature](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/standalone/latest/user-guide/remote-debugging).
