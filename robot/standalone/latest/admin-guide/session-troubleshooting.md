## Windows session is locked

### Description

The robot receives the error "Cannot bring the target application in foreground because the Windows session is locked".

### Potential issues

Unnecessary running of idle Remote Desktop Services sessions, automatic sign-ins and lock of the last interactive user after system restarts, or the activation of news and interests on the taskbar.

### Solution

Ensure the settings for the following group policies are disabled or not configured:

* **News and interests**
* **Session Time Limits** (find it under **Remote Desktop Services** &gt; **Remote Desktop Session Host** )
* **Windows Logon Options**

To do that:

1. Open the **Local Group Policy Editor**.
2. Navigate to **Computer Configuration** &gt; **Administrative Templates** &gt; **Windows Components**.
3. Look for the corresponding policy setting and verify the state is **Not configured** or **Disabled**:
   * For **News and interest**, look for the **Enable news and interests on the taskbar** setting.
   * For **Session Time Limits**, look for the **Set time limit for active but idle Remote Desktop Services sessions** setting.
   * For **Windows Logon Options**, look for the **Sign-in and lock last interactive user automatically after a restart** setting.

If the problem persists, export and send the following text files to UiPath Support:

1. Open the **Local Group Policy Editor**.
2. Navigate to **Computer Configuration** &gt; **Administrative Templates** &gt; **Windows Components**.
3. Select the following policies:
   * **Connections** (find it under **Remote Desktop Services** &gt; **Remote Desktop Session Host** )
   * **Session Time Limits** (find it under **Remote Desktop Services** &gt; **Remote Desktop Session Host** )
4. For each policy, select **Action** from the ribbon and then **Export** the settings with the `.txt` format.

## Previous logon policy prevents Robot session creation

### Description

In unattended scenarios, Robots are unable to log in due to a security pop-up that reports sign-in information. As a result, jobs fail with the following error message: "Could not start executor. A specified logon session does not exist. It may already have been terminated. (0x80070520)".

### Potential issues

The policy **Display information about previous logons during user logon** prevents robot sessions from being created. When this policy is enabled, robots cannot initiate a login session, leading to the error message mentioned above.

### Solution

Disable the **[Display information about previous logons during user logon](https://admx.help/?Category=Windows_10_2016&Policy=Microsoft.Policies.WindowsLogon2::DisplayLastLogonInfoDescription)** policy:

1. Open the **Group Policy Editor** on the affected machines by running `gpedit.msc` from the start menu or Command Prompt.
2. Go to **Computer Configuration** &gt; **Administrative Templates** &gt; **System** &gt; **Logon**.
3. Locate the policy titled **Display information about previous logons during user logon**.
4. Set this policy to **Disabled**.
5. Once the policy is disabled, ensure the changes are applied. You may need to run `gpupdate /force` from the Command Prompt or restart the affected machine.
6. Test whether the robot is able to log in successfully without encountering the error.
