A log entry contains several log fields, each holding a different information about the vent being logged.

## Default fields

* **Message** - The log message.
* **Level** - Defines the log level.
* **Timestamp** - The exact date and time the logged action was happened.
* **FileName** - The name of the `.xaml` file being executed.
* **jobId** (*) - The ID of the job running the process.
* **processName** (*) - The name of the process that triggered the logging. Requires an active connection to Orchestrator.
* **processVersion** (*) - The version number of the process. Requires an active connection to Orchestrator.
* **windowsIdentity** - The name of the user that performed the action that was logged.
* **robotName** (*) - The name of the Robot (as defined in Orchestrator).
* **machineName** - The name of the robot machine.
* **machineId** (*) - The id of the robot machine.
* **organizationUnitId** * - The ID of the Orchestrator organization.

**(*)** These log fields cannot be overridden using the [Add Log Fields](https://docs.uipath.com/activities/other/latest/workflow/add-log-fields) activity.

## User-defined fields

To define custom fields, use the **Add Log Fields** activity. These fields appear in all subsequent logs. To remove these fields from further logs, use the **Remove Log Fields** activity.

:::important
Make sure to name your custom log fields different from the default log fields. Otherwise, duplicate names can corrupt the logging process and disrupt the execution of your workflow.
