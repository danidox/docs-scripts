A licensing process most commonly starts with [activating your Orchestrator license](https://docs.uipath.com/orchestrator/standalone/latest/user-guide/activating-your-license). Afterward, you license your Robot by [connecting it to Orchestrator](https://docs.uipath.com/orchestrator/standalone/latest/user-guide/connecting-robots-to-orchestrator) or from the Command Line, using the LicenseTool utility.

When your Robot is not connected to Orchestrator, you can activate the license with the help of the Command Prompt.

## Attended licenses

To execute attended automations, you need to allocate one or more [user licenses](https://docs.uipath.com/overview/other/latest/overview/user-licensing) to your robots.

For this, you need to have a robot account in Orchestrator. Once the user license is assigned to a specific username, that user can run one or more attended automations on the computer under their username.

The following user licenses are available for attended automations:

* Attended
* Citizen Developer
* Automation Developer

## Unattended licenses

To execute unattended automations, you need to allocate one or more robot licenses (or [runtimes](https://docs.uipath.com/overview/other/latest/overview/service-licensing#runtimes-(robot-licenses))) to your robots, specifically to the machine that hosts your robots. The number of runtimes assigned to a machine represents the maximum number of concurrent executions. For example, with one runtime, you can execute only one unattended automation at a time. With five runtimes, you can execute up to five unattended automations at the same time, on the same host machine.

Depending on the type of automation, allocate the runtimes as follows:

* For foreground automations - allocate one runtime, as this type of automations are executed one at a time.
* For background automations - Windows machines require one runtime, as they execute one background automation at a time. Windows-Server machines can execute several background automations simultaneously, which represents a concurrent execution.
* For concurrent executions - allocate more than one runtime. The number of allocated runtimes determines how many automations you can execute simultaneously on the same machine.

The following runtimes are available for unattended automations:

* Production (Unattended)
* Testing
* App Testing

## LicenseTool utility

The `UiPath.LicenseTool.exe` is a command-line utility which enables you to activate your machine online or offline, and update your license information.

The LicenseTool utility activates your license locally, which requires you to select the Standalone license type when creating a robot in Orchestrator.

The following sections provide the most common commands for online, offline, and generic licensing operations. The commands need to be initiated in the same folder where the utility resides, which be default is the "C:\Program Files\UiPath\Studio" folder.

### Online Operations

The following commands require an active internet connection in order to process your request.

#### Activate

The `activate` command is used to activate a license online via an existing license code. The following parameters are supported:

| Parameter | Description | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-l`, `--LicenseCode` | The license code required for activation. | Mandatory |
| `-u`, `--ProxyUrl` | The URL used for the proxy connection (such as `http://your.proxy.server.com`). | Optional |
| `-p`, `--ProxyPort` | The Port number of the proxy connection. | Optional. Mandatory if the `-u` parameter is used. |
| `-s`, `--ProxyUser` | The username associated with your proxy connection. | Optional. Mandatory if the `-u` parameter is used. |
| `-w`, `--ProxyPassword` | The password for the user associated with your proxy connection. | Optional. Mandatory if the `-u` parameter is used. |

```
C:\Program Files\UiPath\Studio\UiPath.LicenseTool.exe activate -l 1234-1234-2194-5598
License registration state: ActiveLicense
License successfully activated!
```

Online activation can also be done from [Studio](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/standalone/latest/user-guide/activating-your-studio-license#section-online-activation).

#### Update

The `update` command is used update an existing license online. The following parameters are supported:

| Parameter | Description | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `-s`, `--ProxyUser` | The username associated with your proxy connection. | Optional. Mandatory if the `-u` parameter is used. |
| `-w`, `--ProxyPassword` | The password for the user associated with your proxy connection. | Optional. Mandatory if the `-u` parameter is used. |

```
C:\Program Files\UiPath\Studio\UiPath.LicenseTool.exe update
License registration state: ActiveLicense
License successfully updated!
```

#### Deactivate

The `deactivate` command is used to deactivate a local license. This way, the license becomes available for activation on a different computer. The following parameters are supported:

| Parameter | Description | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-u`, `--ProxyUrl` | The URL used for the proxy connection (such as `http://your.proxy.server.com`). | Optional |

License registration state: NoLicenseAvailable
License successfully deactivated!
```

### Offline Operations

#### Activation-Request

The `activation-request` command is used to generate an activation token from your license code. The generated token needs to be used on the [Activation Portal](https://activate.uipath.com/) to generate the corresponding license file. The following parameters are supported:

| Parameter | Description | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-l`, `--LicenseCode` | The license code required for activation. | Mandatory |
| `-o`, `--FileName` | Writes the license information to file. If this parameter is not specified, the license information is displayed in the command prompt window. | Optional |

```

Go to https://activate.uipath.com and paste the activation token in the dialogue box to generate the license file for offline activation.
```

#### Activate-Offline

The `activate-offline` command is used to activate a license offline. It uses the license file generated by the [Activation Portal](https://activate.uipath.com/) from the provided activation token generated by the `activation-request` command. The following parameters are supported:

  ```
  C:\Program Files\UiPath\Studio\UiPath.LicenseTool.exe activate-offline -f c:\Downloads\license.txt
  License registration state: ActiveLicense
  License successfully activated!
  ```

Offline activation can also be done from [Studio](https://docs.uipath.com/studio/standalone/latest/user-guide/activating-your-studio-license#section-online-activation).
