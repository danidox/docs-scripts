## 1002

**Error message:** Robot does not exist.

**Connection status:** Connected but unable to retrieve a license.

**Potential issue:** This error code can appear when 2023.10 and newer robots are connected to Orchestrator 2023.4 and older. The cause of this error could be linked to error codes 1232, 1247, or 1420. For more information, see the solution for error codes 1232, 1247, or 1420.

## 1203

**Error message:** The standard machine does not have an exact match to the name of the machine the robot is installed on.

**Connection status:** Connected but identified configuration issues.

**Potential issue:** The machine key used to connect the robot to Orchestrator is configured to work with a different standard machine.

**Solution:** Check the specific information for the machine configuration in Orchestrator.

## 1230

**Error message:** No robot configured for the current user.

**Connection status:** Connected but unable to retrieve a license.

**Potential issue:** There is no robot configured for the user that attempted to connect to Orchestrator.

**Solution:** Make sure that the user that tries to connect to Orchestrator has a robot configured and tied to its account.

## 1232

**Error message:** Could not find unattended robot for user key {0}.

**Connection status:** Connected but unable to retrieve a license.

**Potential issue:** There are insufficient attended licenses, and the robot switches to unattended licenses.

**Solution:** Create a new unattended robot or re-enable the existing one, if disabled.

## 1247

:::note
This error may occur just before Error 191x appears.
:::

**Error message:** Could not find robot by key {0}.

**Connection status:** Connected but unable to retrieve a license.

**Potential issue:** The robot user is disabled in Orchestrator, so the corresponding Client Credentials are no longer valid.

**Solution:** Create a new robot or re-enable the existing one, if disabled, then restart the robot instance on the machine.

## 1415

**Error message:** No runtime licenses available.

**Connection status:** Connected as Unattended.

**Potential issue:** The user is connected to Orchestrator, but does not have unattended runtimes.

**Solution:** Allocate unattended licenses for the robot machine from Orchestrator: **Tenant** &gt; **Machines** &gt; **Runtime details** &gt; **Production (Unattended)**.

## 1420

**Error message:** The domain/username configured in Orchestrator does not match any user on the machine.

**Connection status:** Connected but identified configuration issues.

**Potential issues:**
* A Machine key or Client ID/Client Secret is used for the connection and the unattended robot credentials in Orchestrator do not match any user on the machine.
* The user does not use a specific Windows user account.

**Solution:** Check the specific information for the user in Orchestrator: **Tenant** &gt; **Manage Access &gt; Edit user** &gt; **Unattended setup** &gt; **Domain/Username.**

## 1431

**Error message:** Invalid authentication token.

**Connection status:** Connected but unable to retrieve a license.

**Potential issue:** The authentication token used to maintain the connection to Orchestrator has expired or is no longer valid.

**Solutions:**
* Check if the robot configuration in Orchestrator is correct and an attended license is available.
* Disconnect and reconnect to Orchestrator, either through Machine Key or Interactive Sign In.

## 1900

**Error message:** No more &lt;License Name&gt; robots available.

**Connection status:** Connected but unable to retrieve a license.

**Potential issue:** The Orchestrator tenant to which the robot is connected does not have any available licenses for the requested type. This can occur when multiple robots share a single license.

**Solution:** Verify the license allocation from the admin panel in Automation Cloud.

## 1905

**Error message:** Update Failed: Please Disconnect Some Machines To Match The Number Of Defined Licenses.

**Connection status:** -

**Potential issue:** There is a mismatch between the updated license and the license Orchestrator expects. For example, upon updating the license, from a total of ten runtimes in the license, the user transfers five from Unattended to Citizen Developer. However, Orchestrator expects 10 available runtimes, and thus, this error occurs.

**Solutions:**
* Remove the existing license, select the **Activate Online** option, then provide the license code again.
* Remove the unattended robot from the **Robots** page in Orchestrator, then on the **Licenses** page in Orchestrator, select the **Update** option. This updates all runtimes.

## 1908

**Error message:** Please remove some Development Robots to match the number of defined licenses.

**Connection status:** -

**Potential issue:** This error occurs when updating the license, if the number of the available runtimes does not match the active runtimes.

**Solution:** Remove the active runtimes from their users, update the license, then allocate runtimes back to users, based on the updated license offer.

## 1912

:::note
This error code applies to connections to Automation Suite Orchestrator.
:::

**Error message:** Action not possible. Valid license is required!

**Connection status:** Connected but unable to retrieve a license.

**Potential issue:** The Orchestrator tenant to which the robot is connected does not have any available licenses.

**Solution:** Make sure that the tenant has enough licenses. Licenses can be assigned by accessing Admin &gt; Tenants &gt; Edit license allocation.

## 1913

:::note
This error code applies to Service URL connections.
:::

**Error message:** There are no available licenses on the server.

**Connection status:** Connected but unable to retrieve a license.

**Potential issues:**
* The Orchestrator tenant to which the robot is connected does not have any available licenses.
* User only has an unattended license assigned and uses interactive sign in to connect to Orchestrator, which depends on an attended license.
* User has only one allocated license and is using two different machines.

**Solutions:**
* Make sure that the tenant has enough licenses. Licenses can be assigned by accessing Orchestrator: **Admin** &gt; **Tenants** &gt; **Edit license allocation**.
* Use the machine key instead: make sure that all requirements are correctly defined in Orchestrator.
* If the user already has an attended license assigned, make sure **[Enable user to run automations](https://docs.uipath.com/orchestrator/automation-cloud-public-sector/latest/user-guide/enabling-users-to-run-personal-automation#enabling-user-groups-to-run-personal-automations)** option **i**s enabled.
* To use a single license on two machines, you must disconnect the first one before connecting the second one.
