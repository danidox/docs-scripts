Package signature is a tool used by NuGet packages to verify their source as being trustworthy. This verification is done using a certificate that helps confirm the identity of the entity that has issued or created the package.

When you enable the certificate check, UiPath validates whether the packages being used come from an approved author or a permitted repository, enhancing the security of the deployment by ensuring that only reliable packages are used.

## Validation modes

Values for the validation mode parameter `signatureValidationMode` decide what kind of packages can be installed.

* If you use `accept`, you can install both signed and unsigned packages.
* If you use `require`, you can only install a package if the signing details have to match the ones from the `<trustedSigners>` section of the `NuGet.config` file.

## Manual setup for signature verification

Before Robot version 2021.2, during the installation, the `NuGet.config` file would be automatically populated with certain configurations:

* `signatureValidationMode`, set to `accept`
* UiPath® is listed as a trusted signer

In Robot versions 2021.2 and later, you are encouraged to make a conscious choice, so these settings are not automatically populated. To continue using the package signature feature, you need to manually edit the `NuGet.config` file and [add the `signatureValidationMode` parameter](https://docs.uipath.com/robot/standalone/latest/admin-guide/package-signature-verification#enabling-package-signatures), and [list UiPath as a trusted source](https://docs.uipath.com/robot/standalone/latest/admin-guide/package-signature-verification#adding-trusted-sources).

:::important
* If you use the `NuGet.org` feed, add it for both `accept` and `require` validation modes, as NuGet announces the whole repository as signed.
* If you do no want to use package signature verification, make sure to remove the `&lt;trustedSigners&gt;` tag from the `NuGet.config` file.

## Enabling package signatures

You can configure the package signature either during the command line installation, or post-installation, by editing the `NuGet.config` file:

1. During command line installation: add the `ENFORCE_SIGNED_EXECUTION=1` argument to the install command.
2. After installation: in the `Nuget.config` file, add the `signatureValidationMode` parameter, and set it to `require`.
   :::note
   * The `NuGet.config` file is stored in the `%ProgramFiles%\UiPath\Studio` folder.
   * For the changes in the `NuGet.config` file to take effect:
   1. Restart the Robot Service.
   2. Remove all existing NuGet packages from `%ProgramFiles%\UiPath\Studio\Packages` and `%userprofile%\.nuget\packages`.
   3. Restart Studio and Assistant.

## Adding trusted sources

To download, install, and run packages signed with a specific certificate, add it as a trusted source.

1. Open the `NuGet.config` file.
2. Under the `<trustedSigners>` section, add the `<author>` tag, and provide the values of a trusted author. For example, UiPath has the following author values:
   ```
   <config>
        <add key="signatureValidationMode" value="require" />
   </config>
   <trustedSigners>
      <author name="UiPath">
         <certificate fingerprint="D179174EBC1E180D656BFB15BE369DEA8A17C178230FAC7771BF5446940C290C" hashAlgorithm="SHA256" allowUntrustedRoot="false"/>
         <certificate fingerprint="ABD1E1BB749DDC96B46A1DBD91B93A2D8B3B5572D1E20A52F6165ED96FC117E0" hashAlgorithm="SHA256" allowUntrustedRoot="false" />
         <certificate fingerprint="A96ADDC7455443CF702A887BC153CF7844038E2E88081D676C57DDD90EC90245" hashAlgorithm="SHA256" allowUntrustedRoot="false" />
      </author>
   </trustedSigners>
   ```
3. Under the `<trustedSigners>` section, add the `<repository>` tag, and provide values of a trusted repository. For example, UiPath has the following repository values:
   ```
   <config>
        <add key="signatureValidationMode" value="require" />
   </config>
   <trustedSigners>
      <repository name="UiPathRepository" serviceIndex="https://gallery.uipath.com/api/v3/index.json">
         <certificate fingerprint="D179174EBC1E180D656BFB15BE369DEA8A17C178230FAC7771BF5446940C290C" hashAlgorithm="SHA256" allowUntrustedRoot="false" />
         <certificate fingerprint="ABD1E1BB749DDC96B46A1DBD91B93A2D8B3B5572D1E20A52F6165ED96FC117E0" hashAlgorithm="SHA256" allowUntrustedRoot="false" />
         <certificate fingerprint="A96ADDC7455443CF702A887BC153CF7844038E2E88081D676C57DDD90EC90245" hashAlgorithm="SHA256" allowUntrustedRoot="false" />
      </repository>
   </trustedSigners>
   ```
4. To add a list of trusted owners, add the `<owners>` tag, and provide the names of the trusted authors. This allows only packages signed by multiple trusted authors.
   ```
   <config>
        <add key="signatureValidationMode" value="require" />
   </config>
   <trustedSigners>
       <repository name="UiPath Repository" serviceIndex="https://uipath.repository">
           <certificate fingerprint="1234512345123451234512345123123123123123123123123123112312312E5" hashAlgorithm="SHA256" allowUntrustedRoot="true" />
           <owners>Author1;Author2;Author3</owners> 
       </repository>
   </trustedSigners>
   ```
